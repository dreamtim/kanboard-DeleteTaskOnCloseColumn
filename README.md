Automatic action: Delete a task when closed in a specified column 
==================================================================================

This plugin allows you to create an automatic action in Kanboard that will delete cards
from a user specified column when the card is closed.

When adding an automatic action, the action name is shown as
"Delete task from a specific column when closed  in a specific column "

The actual deleting of the card takes place when the Card status is changed to Closed. That is how the action is actually triggered.
